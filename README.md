# lum.doxs.js

A document markup format integrating multiple rendering engines into
a single component. The default set being [Twing], [Marked], and [Textile].

Inspired by my older [lum-wiki] PHP library, but meant for in-browser 
rendering instead of server-side, and abandoning all the wiki-formatting 
stuff in favour of making it more flexible instead.

It also has [DOMPurify] and FrontMatter (YAML-headers) support.
