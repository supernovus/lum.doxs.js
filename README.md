# lum.doxs.js

## THIS BRANCH IS EXPERIMENTAL AND VERY BROKEN

A document markup format integrating [Twing], [Marked], and [Textile].

Inspired by my older [lum-wiki] PHP library, but meant for in-browser 
rendering instead of server-side, and abandoning all the wiki-formatting 
stuff in favour of making it more flexible instead.

It also integrates [DOMPurify] to handle XSS sanitization.

## Official URLs

This library can be found in two places:

 * [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lumjs/doxs)
